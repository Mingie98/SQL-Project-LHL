# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goals for this project is to answer the provided questions about the database as well as coming with a few of our own. The database is quite messy and needs some work to be done before we can use it to answer the questions 

## Process
### Step 1. I first started by familiarizing myself with the database by running a couple of SELECT * statements from the different tables. 
### Step 2. After getting familiar with the database, I start tackling the questions of the assignment. Even though the database is very messy, I focusing on cleaning only the data that is relevant to the questions that are asked.
### Step 3. My preferred method of working with the database is by creating temporary tables that will then let me run queries that can answer the questions.

## Results
It would seem that a great deal of relevant data comes from the United States. We are able to make some inferences out of that such as the most purchased product categories or where do the revenues generated comes from.  

## Challenges 
The greatest challenge is the messiness of the database and the lack of documentation that could help orient ourselves better. There is also a lot of duplicate data and no primary/foreign key is defined that could help clean it.

## Future Goals
One main goal would be to establish primary/foreign key relationship as it would help clean the database further more easily.
